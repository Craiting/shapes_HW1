## Homework 1

To run the program all you need to do in your terminal is run ```python main.py``` and give it a file type by typing either 'json' or 'xml'. Next you will need to give it a filename. I have provided a properly formatted json and xml called ```shapes.json``` and ```shapes.xml```. If you choose to output to a file you will find the output go to a file called output.csv.

To run the tests just run ```python tests.py``` in the terminal. The tests use testjson.json and testxml.xml to help test parsing and things.
